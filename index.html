    <h1>A Treatise on Advocacy Work</h1>
    <p> 
1. Advocacy work is fundamentally varied and diverse as a practice.  Yet the inhabiting dynamic energy which all advocacy work shares in common can be described in the following way: an objective to make better something for someone.  Someone refers to any living being or group thereof, but need not be closed on this condition – it might make reference to more “spiritual” subjects.  In this regard, human demographic groups or animal groups are the traditional “someone”, but Mother Gaia could be considered a “someone” too in deep-ecology advocacy.  Work done in favour of religious principles, which similarly makes reference to a subject that is not, strictly-speaking, a living being, is also advocacy work in this sense.</p>
<p>
2. With this common feature of advocacy work clearly defined, the diversity of actions and ideas which are to be called ‘advocacy’ can be seen with a heightened clarity.  Then, the possibility of identifying, then classifying advocacy work, which includes both actions and ideas, into categories and forms – becomes a much more trivial task.  Indeed we begin by stratifying advocacy work into two broad categories: Positive Advocacy Work (PAW) in principle is work which seeks to improve conditions for someone.  The associated principle of ‘seeking to improve’ that all PAW possesses is the improvement principle.  Negative Advocacy Work (NAW) is work which in principle seeks to avoid worsening conditions for someone.  The associated principle of ‘seeking to avoid worsening’ is the worsening principle.  Advocacy work may in practice be done with both the improvement and worsening principles in mind, but must only be classified as either PAW or NAW.  Then, we can define the goal or goals of advocacy work as being either improvement or worsening principled goal(s), and proceed to denote them as Principled Goal(s).  Thus, the two categories are disjoint, yet their principles are overlapping.</p>
<p>
3. This project is particularly interested in a form of advocacy work that we will call Physical Advocacy Work (PHAW), which is defined as work which seeks first to affect the physical world.  PHAW exists in contrast to work which seeks first to affect social relations, which is appropriately named “Social Advocacy Work” (SAW).  Advocacy which takes either of these two forms may belong to either (but not both) of the two previously outlined categories of positive or negative advocacy work.  Advocacy work often deals with both the social and the physical, affecting either the improvement or worsening principle (or both) in both of the two forms, PHAW and SAW.    Although we allow this possibility, the logic of advocacy categories is replicated in that advocacy work cannot belong to both PHAW and SAW, even if it is aimed at affecting both the social and the physical.  Advocacy work must have a primary objective which relates either to the social or the physical, and which determines its category.</p>
<p>
4. For example, we consider advocacy work aimed at improving accessible housing supply.  The someone is differently abled individuals, especially those who are experiencing homelessness or who live in non-accessible housing.  This work is PAW, since it seeks to make an improvement for its someone.  This work seeks both to improve social relations and physical conditions in the physical world, but its primary goal is to provide housing, which is a physical condition.  Since we cannot classify the form of advocacy work as both PHAW and SAW, we classify it as PHAW.  Some of this logic depends implicitly on the assumption that physical relations determine social relations more than the converse is true.  We might say that the Advcocacy Work is “housing advocacy that is accessibility implicated”, which orders the physical ahead of the social.  Here, I argue that this example should serve as a precedent: that physical relations in advocacy take precedence over social ones (a statement which, if accepted, can readily be applied outside of just classifying advocacy work).</p>
<p>
5. We may encounter work which is both PAW and SAW, NAW and PHAW, PAW and PHAW, or NAW and SAW.  There exist no other combinations for classifying advocacy work under this view.  We may note the existence of a far greater number of prominent examples of SAW which is also NAW, compared to PHAW which is also NAW.  In other words, this observation suggests that Physical Advocacy Work is often interested in buiding a better physical world, whereas Social Advocacy Work is oftentimes occupied with protecting existing social conditions by opposing propositions that could jeopardize these conditions.
